        <h2>Designer</h2>
        <p>
          Design is the most important part of a project. Many great products
          fail due to poor design. No matter how technically advanced your
          project may be, no one will care if it isn't designed to work well. I
          feel you can't design without understanding the entire package, from
          logo design in graphics all the way to button placement with UX-UI
          design. This is my passion and I strive to achieve an overall design
          plan that works, from colors to structure. Sometimes simple is best,
          sometimes you need to use the current technology. The decision isn't
          always easy, but the end design will benefit when the right choice is
          made.

        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>
          While design is my passion, I understand there is so much more you can
          do when you understand the code behind what is happening. This is why
          I want to understand what's going on under the hood and not just plug
          boxes in the right places. Understanding how something gets done helps
          make the decision on if it needs to be done. Complicated code brings
          its own problems; understanding that code helps eliminate those
          problems. I strive to understand the code to help the client get not
          only what they want, but what they need.
